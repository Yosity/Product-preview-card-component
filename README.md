This is the first front-end mentor challenge !

I designed it mostly using nested layout technique. I also used other ideas like flex box and position.
It was my first time using media queries aswell and I had hard time with it.

Since it was my first time designing a responsive page it turned out to be bit chaotic but I got the job done.
I'd appreciate if you could review my work and give me tips on better ways to do it.

That's all I got, Thanks :)
